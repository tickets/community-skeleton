Installation
--------------

The installation process is broken down into two distinct steps:

* Setup
* Configuration

### Setting up your helpdesk project

In this step of the installation process, you'll be downloading the helpdesk project skeleton and installing all of its dependent components.

As per your convenience, you can choose to either use composer for download the project and install all its dependencies automatically or directly download the project archive that comes pre-packaged with all of the project dependencies already installed.

We recommend using composer over direct download whenever possible. However, if your system does not have enough ram to execute composer operations properly (for example: installing on a shared host with limited system resources), we suggest using the direct download method instead to mitigate these kind of issues.

Irrespective of the method you use, the process to configuring your helpdesk remains the same.

#### Composer

You can use composer to setup your project by simply running the following command from your terminal:

```bash
$ composer create-project uvdesk/community-skeleton helpdesk-project
```

#### Direct Download

Alternatively, you can also [download the zip archive](https://cdn.uvdesk.com/uvdesk/downloads/opensource/uvdesk-community-current-stable.zip) of the latest stable release and extract its content by running the following commands from your terminal:

```bash
$ wget "https://cdn.uvdesk.com/uvdesk/downloads/opensource/uvdesk-community-current-stable.zip" -P /var/www/
$ unzip -q /var/www/uvdesk-community-current-stable.zip -d /var/www/ \
```

### Configuring your helpdesk project

After you've downloaded and installed all the project dependencies, you can configure your helpdesk installation using either of the following ways:

#### Using Terminal

```bash
$ php bin/console uvdesk:configure-helpdesk
```

#### Using Web Installer Wizard

After opening your project in the web browser, you will be greeted by the web installer which will guide you in configuring your project.

Docker Runtime
--------------

You can also dockerize your helpdesk project to easily deploy your setup from within a docker container.

To build an image, simply switch to your project's directory and run the following command:

```bash
$ docker build -t {IMAGE_NAME} .
```

Upon successfull execution, this will create a docker image with the specified tag using the -t option. You can use this image to deploy your helpdesk project using either `docker run` or `docker-compose`.

### Deploying Containers

Containers can be launched using one of the two given methods:

#### Using Docker Run

You can simply launch a standalone container using the following command:

```bash
# If you wish to use a local database within container
$ docker run -dit -p {AVAILABLE_PORT}:80 \
    -e MYSQL_USER={MYSQL_USER} \
    -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD={MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD} \
    -e MYSQL_PASSWORD={MYSQL_PASSWORD} \
    -e MYSQL_DATABASE={MYSQL_DATABASE} \
    --name {CONTAINER_NAME} {IMAGE_NAME}

# If you wish to use an external database outside container
$ docker run -dit -p {AVAILABLE_PORT}:80 --name {CONTAINER_NAME} {IMAGE_NAME}
```

#### Using Docker Compose

Create a configuration file docker-compose.yaml and set it's configuration details as follows:

```bash
version: '3'
services:
    uvdesk:
        image: {IMAGE_NAME}:latest
        tty: true
        environment:
            MYSQL_USER: {MYSQL_USER}
            MYSQL_PASSWORD: {MYSQL_PASSWORD}
            MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: {MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD}
            MYSQL_DATABASE: {MYSQL_DATABASE}
        ports:
            - {AVAILABLE_PORT}:80
```

Once you've created the configuration file, deploy your containers as services using the following command:

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d -f {PATH_TO_DOCKER_FILE}
```

References:
* **IMAGE_NAME**: Name of the image to being build
* **CONTAINER_NAME**: Name of the created container
* **AVAILABLE_PORT**: Map port 80 (apache) within the container to an available port on your host
* **MYSQL_USER**: MySQL user name
* **MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD**: MySQL root user password
* **MYSQL_PASSWORD**: MySQL user password
* **MYSQL_DATABASE**: MySQL database name
